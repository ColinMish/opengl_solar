# opengl_solar
A simple solar system created in C++ OpenGL by Colin Mackey using existing code by Dr. Iain Martin. The system approximately models the rotation and orbital speeds of Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon and Mars (Mars' orbit is tilted to make it a bit more interesting).

This project uses example lab code from Dr. Iain Martin at the University of Dundee for the 4th year Graphics module.

Controls:
e - increase y-rotation speed
r - decrease y-rotation speed
n - cycle vertex, mesh and filled polygon modes
m - toggle colour mode
